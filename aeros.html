          Aerosmith is an American rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970.[5] The group consists of Steven Tyler (vocals, keyboards), Joe Perry (guitar), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums), and Brad Whitford (guitar). Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock,[6][7] has come to also incorporate elements of pop rock,[8] heavy metal,[6] and rhythm and blues,[9] and has inspired many subsequent rock artists.[10] They are sometimes referred to as "the Bad Boys from Boston"[11] and "America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band".[12][13][14][15]

          Perry and Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with Tyler, Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston. They were signed to Columbia Records in 1972, and released a string of gold and platinum albums, beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album, followed by Get Your Wings in 1974.[16] In 1975, the band broke into the mainstream with the album Toys in the Attic, and their 1976 follow-up Rocks cemented their status as hard rock superstars.[17] Draw the Line and Night in the Ruts followed in 1977 and 1979 respectively. Their first five albums have since attained multi-platinum status. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Billboard Hot 100 singles, including their first Top 40 hit "Sweet Emotion" and the Top 10 hits "Dream On" and "Walk This Way". By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a following of fans, often referred to as the "Blue Army".[18] However, drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band, which led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay.[7] The band did not fare well between 1980 and 1984, releasing the album Rock in a Hard Place, which was certified gold but failed to match their previous successes.<br>

<p id="uno">  In 1964, Steven Tyler formed his own band called the Strangeurs—later Chain Reaction—in Yonkers, NY.[25] Meanwhile, Perry and Hamilton formed the Jam Band (commonly known as "Joe Perry's Jam Band"), which was based on free-form and blues. Hamilton and Perry moved to Boston, Massachusetts in September 1969.[26] There they met Joey Kramer, a drummer from Yonkers, New York. Kramer knew Tyler and had always hoped to play in a band with him.[27] Kramer, a Berklee College of Music student, decided to leave the school, and joined Jam Band.[27]

        In 1970, Chain Reaction and Jam Band played at the same gig. Tyler immediately loved Jam Band's sound, and wanted to combine the two bands. In October 1970, the bands met up again and considered the proposition. Tyler, who had been a drummer and backup singer in Chain Reaction, adamantly refused to play drums in this new band, insisting that he would take part only if he could be frontman and lead vocalist. The others agreed, and a new band was formed. The band moved into a home together at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue[28] in Boston, where they wrote and rehearsed music together and relaxed in between shows.[27]
        
        The members of the band reportedly spent afternoons getting stoned and watching Three Stooges reruns.[29] One day, they had a post-Stooges meeting to try to come up with a name. Kramer said that, when he was in school, he would write the word "aerosmith" all over his notebooks.[30] The name had popped into his head after listening to Harry Nilsson's album Aerial Ballet, which featured jacket art of a circus performer jumping out of a biplane. Initially, Kramer's bandmates were unimpressed; they all thought he was referring to the Sinclair Lewis novel they were required to read in high school English class. "No, not Arrowsmith," Kramer explained. "A-E-R-O...Aerosmith."[31] The band settled upon this name after also considering "the Hookers" and "Spike Jones."[30][32]
        
        Soon, the band hired Ray Tabano, a childhood friend of Tyler, as rhythm guitarist and began playing local shows.[33] Aerosmith played their first gig in Mendon, Massachusetts at Nipmuc Regional High School (now Miscoe Hill Middle School) on November 6, 1970. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, who also attended the Berklee School of Music, and was formerly a member of the band Earth Inc.[34] Whitford, from Reading, Massachusetts, had already played at Reading's AW Coolidge Middle School. Other than a period from July 1979 to April 1984, the line-up of Tyler, Perry, Hamilton, Kramer, and Whitford has stayed the same.[6]  </p>
        <p id="dos"> After forming the band and finalizing the lineup in 1971, the band started to garner some local success doing live shows.[7] Originally booked through the Ed Malhoit Agency,[35] the band signed a promotion deal with Frank Connelly, and eventually secured a management deal with David Krebs and Steve Leber in 1972.[36] Krebs and Leber invited Columbia Records President Clive Davis to see the band at Max's Kansas City in New York City. Aerosmith was not originally scheduled to play that night at the club, but they paid out of their own pockets to secure a place on the bill, reportedly the only band ever to do so at Max's. "No Surprize" from their Night in the Ruts album celebrated the moment their fame rose.[37]

                Aerosmith signed with Columbia in mid-1972 for a reported $125,000, and released their debut album, Aerosmith.[38] Released in January 1973, the album peaked at number 166.[6] The album was straightforward rock and roll with well-defined blues influences, laying the groundwork for Aerosmith's signature blues rock sound.[39] Although the highest-charting single from the album was "Dream On" at number 59,[40] several tracks, such as "Mama Kin" and "Walkin' the Dog", would become staples of the band's live shows, and received airplay on rock radio.[41] The album reached gold status initially, eventually went on to sell two million copies, and was certified double platinum after the band reached mainstream success over a decade later.[42] After constant touring, the band released their second album, Get Your Wings in 1974, the first of a string of multi-platinum albums produced by Jack Douglas.[43] This album included the rock radio hits "Same Old Song and Dance" and "Train Kept A-Rollin'", a cover done previously by the Yardbirds.[44] The album also contained several fan favorites, including "Lord of the Thighs", "Seasons of Wither", and "S.O.S. (Too Bad)", darker songs that have become staples in the band's live shows.[45] To date, Get Your Wings has sold three million copies.[42]
                
                In 1975, Aerosmith released their third album, Toys in the Attic, which established Aerosmith as international stars, competing with the likes of Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones.[18] Originally derided as Rolling Stones knockoffs in part due to the physical resemblance between lead singers Steven Tyler and Mick Jagger,[7] Toys in the Attic showed that Aerosmith was a unique and talented band in their own right.[46] Toys in the Attic was an immediate success, starting with the single "Sweet Emotion", which became the band's first Top 40 hit.[47] This was followed by a successful re-release of "Dream On" which hit #6, becoming their best charting single of the 1970s.[48] "Walk This Way", re-released in 1976, reached the Top 10 in early 1977.[7]
                
                In addition, "Toys in the Attic" and "Big Ten Inch Record" (a song originally recorded by Bull Moose Jackson) became concert staples.[49] As a result of this success, both of the band's previous albums re-charted.[50] Toys in the Attic has gone on to become the band's bestselling studio album in the United States, with certified U.S. sales of eight million copies.[42] The band toured in support of Toys in the Attic, where they started to get more recognition.[18] Also around this time, the band established their home base as "the Wherehouse" in Waltham, Massachusetts, where they would record and rehearse music, as well as conduct business.[51]</p>
<p id="tres">       
        In 1976, Aerosmith's fourth album was Rocks, which "captured Aerosmith at their most raw and rocking".[52] It went platinum swiftly[42] and featured two Top 40 hits, "Last Child" and "Back in the Saddle", as well as the ballad "Home Tonight", which also charted.[53] Rocks would eventually go on to sell over four million copies.[42] Both Toys in the Attic and Rocks are highly regarded,[46][52] especially in the hard rock genre: they appear on such lists as Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time,[54][55] and are cited as influential by members of Guns N' Roses, Metallica, and Mötley Crüe.[56][57] Kurt Cobain also listed Rocks as one of the albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana’s sound in his journal in 1993.[58] Soon after Rocks was released, the band continued to tour heavily, this time headlining their own shows, including large stadiums and rock festivals.[7]

        In 1977, Aerosmith's released their fifth album, Draw the Line. Its recording was affected by the band's excesses, but the record still had memorable moments.[53] The title track charted just shy of the Top 40 and remains a live staple, and "Kings and Queens" also charted.[53] The album went on to sell two million copies.[42] The band toured extensively in support of the album, but drug abuse and the fast-paced life of touring and recording began affecting their performances. Tyler and Perry became known as "the Toxic Twins" due to their notorious abuse of drugs on and off the stage.[7][59] Tyler later commented, “I've spent $64 million on drugs”; Perry scoffed later, "There's no fucking way in the world you could spend that much money on drugs and still be alive. It makes a good headline – but, practically speaking, that was probably a very small portion of where we spent our money."[60]
        
        While continuing to tour and record in the late 1970s, Aerosmith appeared in the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band movie.[6] Their cover of The Beatles' "Come Together", from the soundtrack, was the band's last Top 40 hit for nearly 10 years.[53] The double vinyl Live! Bootleg, issued in 1978, captured the band's rawness[61] during the Draw the Line tour. The standalone single "Chip Away the Stone", also released in 1978, charted at number 77.[53]
